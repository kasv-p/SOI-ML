-->data remove \r\n make like fer-2013 csv found in online ✅
-->try https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/11/facial-emotion-detection-using-cnn/ this on fer-2013 and on our own made dataset ✅
-->conlusion - no need to convert images like that we can use fer2013.csv or we can use imagedatagen kind of function instead of converting the image to pixels
-->find the kaggle previous code notebooks
-->check vgg16 network for model architecture

-->plan how to run model effeciently colab or kaggle or somewhere
-->try to use free platform to make use of gpu or tpu
-->find the tech stacks to build ui components for emotion detection
-->make a rough design of the gui in paint or somewhere
